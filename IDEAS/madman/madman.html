summary: People who love heavy-load, long-distance hiking are crazy.

<p>Completely crazy, and on top of that, an outdoor PUA-level psycho. So why do I love heavy-load and long-distance hiking so much?</p>
<p>This seemingly simple question stumped me for quite a while. After much thought, here’s my take: <strong>heavy-load long hikes give me a rare survival environment: I don’t just have to feed my sense of security; I also need to nourish both my body and soul.</strong> Only by doing this can I survive safely and, if I'm lucky, make it out of the mountains feeling accomplished.</p>
<p>According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, feeding your sense of security broadly means meeting basic physiological, safety, social, and esteem needs: eating well, sleeping soundly, staying 'regular', and hiking smoothly. Plus, making sure your teammates aren't bickering or holding you back—things that might seem trivial, but to an unwashed mountain dweller, they’re pure gold. Achieving this relies on two things: good weather and your own ability to handle it all. After all, days before setting out, you're already stressing over a million questions like, 'Should I bring both softshell and hardshell jackets?' or 'Is my Z700 sleeping bag warm enough?' Just listing all these little concerns would make people think you’re a lunatic, chanting on and on like a monk. Of course, practice makes perfect. After a few trips, you’ll know your preferences and gear so well that making a checklist becomes second nature.</p>
<p>Is that all? Exactly NO! A key element is your teammates. Teammates who don’t suck are a blessing. To avoid bad team dynamics, it helps to have a fixed hiking partner—someone you've hiked with before, ideally on similar heavy-load, long-distance treks. Only then can you truly understand each other's temperaments and abilities.</p>
<p>Feeding both body and soul, for me, is the trump card. On a long, heavy-load hike, you're really only relying on yourself. Sure, teammates are important, but not that important. Because when personal safety isn't guaranteed, no one’s obligated to wait for or take care of you. You have to constantly watch your step, monitor your GPS, and be aware of the surroundings. You’ll endure leg, back, and muscle pain, pushing yourself step by step to the campsite. Even when you're on the verge of collapse, you'll dig deep and keep going on sheer willpower. You have to be 100% mentally confident because you’re all you’ve got. This intense sense of self-reliance is incredibly captivating in hindsight.</p>
<p>Every time I make it out of the mountains, I say: &quot;Thank goodness it's over!&quot; Then, &quot;Wow, I’m really awesome!&quot; And finally, &quot;Never again with the heavy-load, long-distance hikes!&quot; But soon enough, I'll be like, &quot;Hey, want to hit that trail again?Yeah. Heavy load! Long distance!&quot;</p>
